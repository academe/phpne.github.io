## Onion Architecture - Long Live the Code! - [Ian Wood][6]

We are faced with many choices when developing software.
How can we ensure that the choices we make don’t consign our code to an early grave?

With the number of frameworks available, and their recommendations in use, many projects are produced, deployed and subsequently stuck with technologies that were chosen in the embryonic stages.
How can we get our projects and lives into a place where these decisions can be changed?

Designing our applications independently of frameworks, persistence storage technologies, etc while still “standing on the giants” could help those projects live way beyond Kohana!

## Ian Wood

Ian is platform engineer at [Moltin][8], the quicker way to build e-commerce applications.

After the event, many of us will be going to [The Ware Rooms][7] next door for some liquid refreshments.

A week later than usual due to a pre-booking at Campus North, this months event will be on the 27th of May. We are running a lightning talks event. We have a few speakers already lined up, but we need more.

Perhaps you are new to public speaking and want to start off with a lightning talk? Maybe you have been working with a new library / framework / componenet / service that you think the group would like to hear about, or perhaps you have been working on an interesting project and you want to share how you built it.

Please get in touch through either the [Google Group][1] or [Twitter][2] if you would like to speak. You have two weeks to prepare a 5 minute presentation - so there is plenty of time!

Details of confirmed speakers will be announced shortly. 

This is our second event at [Campus North][3], Sunco House, 5 Carliol Square, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE1 6UF, and there will be Pizza sponsored by [Sharpe Recruitment][4]

It's that time of year again, and as such they'll be no March User Group meeting as we'll all be at [PHP North East Conference 2014][1].

This year's schedule is looking fantastic, it covers a wide range of skills and technologies so be sure to check it out at [http://conference.phpne.org.uk/schedule.html][2].

We've also teamed up with [SendGrid][3] to provide this year's post-conference social. We've hired Newcastle's newest, and some say poshest, bowling alley in town, Lane7. Head on over to [http://conference.phpne.org.uk/social.html][4] to find out more.

We really do hope you can join us. If you haven't got a ticket yet, you can grab a ticket or two at [https://phpne14.eventbrite.co.uk][5].

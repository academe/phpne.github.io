## Adventures in Laravel and Performance: Looking Beyond Eloquent by Jamie Hurst

[Eloquent][7] is splendid ORM - it’s quick, easy to set up, and works brilliantly to get your application into production. But what happens when your database architecture can’t quite fit into Eloquent’s pattern, and your performance is suffering even when eager loading and querying responsibly? This talk will describe a few approaches used on a recent project with some challenging requirements, and how you can still use Eloquent, with a sprinkling of overrides and events, along with some careful debugging and profiling, to get the most from your code. Caution: this talk may be opinionated!

A developer with a slightly infamous client, [Jamie][8] has been building websites that can cause your eyes to bleed since 2007. 
He’s now CTO of [JimJam][9], a health-tech startup changing the way physiotherapy works. 
He uses a mix of PHP, Node, Go, and occasionally some front-end - he uses Laravel, Lumen, Slim and more, depending on project requirements. 
Outside of development, he has a questionable taste in cars and music.

After the event, many of us will be going to the [Ware Rooms][10] next door for some liquid refreshments.

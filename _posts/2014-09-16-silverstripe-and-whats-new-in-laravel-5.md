We are pleased to announce the September 2014 event for PHP North East. We have two talks this month: Silverstripe and What’s New in Laravel <del>4.3</del> <ins>5</ins>.

The event will take place at the Campus North, Sunco House, 5 Carliol Square, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE1 6UF (location map at bottom of [Ignite](http://ignite100.com/#contact) site). Thanks to [Campus North](http://campusnorth.co.uk/) for their sponsorship of a free venue and pre-event drinks.

As usual, special thanks to the generous sponsorship of [Laura Sharpe](https://twitter.com/sharperecruit) of [Sharpe Recruitment](http://sharperecruitment.co.uk/), there will once again be a stack of pizzas for you to enjoy before the talk. If you are looking for your next challenge, or need to expand you team, look no further! Also, thanks to Ignite and Campus North for use of the venue.

The event is free and open to all, but please sign up online so that we have an idea of numbers for the venue, and how much Laura needs to cough up for the pizzas. Feedback, suggestions and ideas for future topics are welcome on our [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/php-north-east).

Please promote this event via Twitter or your own website to help us spread the word.

## Silverstripe by Dylan Wagstaff

Dylan is an immigrant from New Zealand bringing not only himself but also his knowledge of a popular framework/CMS from his native country called SilverStripe. In his talk entitled “An Introduction to SilverStripe” he will be exploring the many uses and features as well as a quick rundown of how to get started.

## What’s New in Laravel <del>4.3</del> <ins>5</ins> by Martin Bean

Laravel 5 (formerly known as Laravel 4.3) is coming in November with some fundamental changes. So what are they? Martin Bean will walk us through them.

After the event, we will go to the pub round the corner for some informal discussions and some refreshing beverages.

## Readable Requests and Responses with RAML by [Nathan Dunn][1]

Ever needed an easy way to design, document and test an API?
[RAML][7] is a tool used by companies such as Spotify, Cisco, and VMWare to take the headache out of prototyping complex APIs.
This talk covers how to prototype a simple API by using the all-new RAML 1.0 specification and the tooling surrounding it.

Nathan is a PHP developer at [papertrail.io][8], a Software-as-a-Service product which helps companies comply with health and safety legislation.

After the event, many of us will be going to the [Ware Rooms][9] next door for some liquid refreshments.

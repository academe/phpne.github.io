We are pleased to announce the first PHP North East talk of 2015, "RabbitMQ: I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes" by [Anthony Sterling][1].

Anthony is a Software Engineer, and Technical Director at [Drummond Central][2] - a marketing, creative, and digital agency based in Newcastle upon Tyne.

## RabbitMQ: I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes

Starting with a quick introduction to queueing, this talk will show you how Messaging, with [RabbitMQ][3], can make your application workflow leaner, and your code cleaner.

This talk will aim to cover the following points:-

- Queueing
- AMQP
- Nomenclature
- RabbitMQ's implementation of AMQP
- Example uses
- Installation (with Vagrant/Puppet)
- Example application
- Attempt, and obvious failure, at a live demo

The event will take place at the Campus North, Sunco House, 5 Carliol Square, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE1 6UF (location map at bottom of [Ignite][4] site). Thanks to [Campus North][5]) for their sponsorship of a free venue and pre-event drinks.

As usual, special thanks to the generous sponsorship of [Laura Sharpe][6] of [Sharpe Recruitment][7], there will once again be a stack of pizzas for you to enjoy before the talk. If you are looking for your next challenge, or need to expand you team, look no further! Also, thanks to Ignite and Campus North for use of the venue.

The event is free and open to all, but please sign up online so that we have an idea of numbers for the venue, and how much Laura needs to cough up for the pizzas. Feedback, suggestions and ideas for future topics are welcome on our [Google Group][8].

Please promote this event via Twitter or your own website to help us spread the word. After the event, we will go to the pub round the corner for some informal discussions and some refreshing beverages.

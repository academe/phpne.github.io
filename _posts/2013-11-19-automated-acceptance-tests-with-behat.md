[Behat][1] is a powerful behavour-driven-development testing framework for PHP. Combined with Mink, and you can quickly start writing acceptance tests for your application, plug-in a headless browser like Phantom and you can automate it, without the hastle of selenium.

Let's walk through setting up automated acceptance testing for a simple application, testing authentication, content creation and even payment processing, cleaning up test data once its done.

[Michael Peacock][2] is the CTO at [Ground Six][3], author and occasional speaker.

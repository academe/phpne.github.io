This talk aims to cover why you may want to use abstraction, why you will have to use it, how it all fits into the PHP ecosystem, and what libraries are out there to help you, focusing on [FlySystem][1] as a great example.

Jason ([@JasonDJudge][2]) has been programming since the ZX81 days and has been doing PHP and MySQL for over ten years, building on a background in shell scripting, C and Oracle. 
 
After doing stints at BT, Northern Electric and Cambridge University, he now writes Laravel portals for SugarCRM back-ends, and spends his time keeping a number of large WooCommerce sites afloat as they bloat into data hell.

title: PHP, Handle with Care

We all have a PHP handler somewhere in our stack, but it's often a component that's overlooked and misunderstood. This talk will cover the pros and cons of the four most common handlers used today - suPHP, DSO, CGI and FastCGI - touching on the performance and security of each one. I'll also be exploring a new experimental approach to server setup that combines the benefits from each handler.

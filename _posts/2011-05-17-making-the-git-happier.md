Already we are now round to the fourth PHP North-East community meeting, which this month is taking place in the Cinema Room in the basement of The Town Wall public house. The meeting is free and open to all - so feel free to come along and see what the group is all about. For more information about PHP North-East, feel free to join our [Google Group][1] and be sure to follow our [Twitter account][2] for the latest news.

[Anthony Sterling][3] has once again been bullied into arranging for some chip butties for us, so there will be nibbles and networking with fellow PHP enthusiasts.
This month features a talk from Jon Park of happie.st, your social motivation network to explore, create and share in life's happiest experiences.

**Making the Git Happier** - [Jon Park][4]

Git is an immensely popular version control tool that aims to make risk cheaper. Rather than having to rely on multiple-undos or the autosave functionality of modern editors, Git allows you to control when and how you commit changes to your project; and all without messing up your well-organised file structures.

This talk will start by giving an overview of the basic use of Git to manage a PHP project, working as an individual or small team. It will look at the concept of branching to manage feature development and a tried-and-tested method of branching structure that we use ourselves at happiest.

The topics of the talk will include:

 - Initialising your repository
 - The small handful of commands you need in your day-to-day coding
 - Branching and merging
 - Using Dropbox as a central repository for you and your team
 - Organising your branches for best effect

This will be a brief introduction to the methods we have successfully co-opted into our workflow at happiest and, if anything, will provide a great springboard to continue your learnings around this great little tool.

We are pleased to announce the December event for PHP North East, **Know Your Place**.

The event will take place at the Post Office in Pink Lane ([@PostOfficeNE1][1]) courtesy of PNE.  Thanks to the generous sponsorship of Laura Sharpe of [Sharpe Recruitment][2], there will once again be a stack of pizzas before the talk.

The event is free and open to all, but please sign up online so that we have an idea of numbers for the venue, and how much Laura needs to cough up for the pizzas.  Feedback, suggestions and ideas for future topics are welcome on our [Google Group][3].

Please promote this event via Twitter or your own website to help us spread the word.

**Know Your Place** - A festive treat from [@cheeryfella][4] (Ian Wood)

Whether you are looking at site structure, forum threads, post comments or product categories maintaining the relationship between these elements is desirable if not essential.  We need to know who commented on what or which gear box we need for that moped in the garage.
 
Most databases (MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle etc.) store data as flat lists - not exactly what we are looking for. So we have the task of building (and maintaining) these associations by ourselves.
 
In this presentation we'll take a look at some of the solutions and their implementations. Starting with adjacency lists moving through path enumeration, nested sets and finally closure tables.  A brief look at the benefits and drawbacks of each solution with some queries along the way.
 
If you associate data then this should be of interest - hopefully even useful!

Followed by Q&A at the venue time permitting, or down the pub afterwards.

Many of us will be enjoying a refreshing beverage or two after the talks at the Town Wall Pub in Pink Lane, it would be great if you could join us for that too.

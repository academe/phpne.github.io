#I have a NoSQL toaster, why would I want a NoSQL database?

There has been an explosion in the number of databases available to us and most of them are promising exciting things such as scalability and exotic new data models. Once you get beyond the surface, what is that they offer and when should we use them? With any luck, that's what this talk will answer.  

[Matthew Revell][1] has been knocking around the open source world in one form or another for a while now. He is a Technical Evangelist at [Basho][2], which basically means he gets to come and talk to people about [Riak][3] and NoSQL in general.  

[Basho][2] is the company behind [Riak][3]. Riak is a distributed key-value store offering high availability, data redundancy and massive scalability. It's open source and on GitHub. You should [try it][3].

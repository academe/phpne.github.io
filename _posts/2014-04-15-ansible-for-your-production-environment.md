This month Keith ([@Pincombe][1]) will be explaining how he uses [Ansible][2] to provision and maintain his production environment. During his talk he will go through basic setup, he will then follow on to a full demonstration explaining some tips for getting round common issues.

We are hoping to have one or two lightning talks after the main talk - if you have a talk to give, please let us know on the [Google Group][3] we are also always looking for speakers and talks for future events, maybe you are a first time speaker and want to test the water with a short lightning talk first?

This is our first event at [Campus North][4], Sunco House, 5 Carliol Square, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE1 6UF

We are pleased to announce the PHP North East talk for February 2015, “Frameworks - do you still need one?” by Jamie Hurst.

Jamie is web developer/director at [HurstDev](http://www.hurstdev.co.uk/).

# Frameworks: do you still need one?

PHP has been evolving lately. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) swept in and changed how dependencies can be used in our projects, and made it easy for us to include reusable code and components in all of our projects. I’ll show you that thanks to these components and libraries, you don’t even need a framework anymore! This talk will be an introduction to using components such as [Pimple](http://pimple.sensiolabs.org/), [Eloquent](http://laravel.com/docs/master/eloquent) and [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) to build your own system architecture, and may even include the fabled live demo…

The event will take place at the Campus North, Sunco House, 5 Carliol Square, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE1 6UF (location map at bottom of [Ignite](http://ignite.io/) site). Thanks to [Campus North](http://campusnorth.co.uk/) for their sponsorship of a free venue and pre-event drinks.

As usual, special thanks to the generous sponsorship of Laura Sharpe of [Sharpe Recruitment](http://www.sharperecruitment.co.uk/), there will once again be a stack of pizzas for you to enjoy before the talk. If you are looking for your next challenge, or need to expand you team, look no further!

The event is free and open to all, but please sign up online so that we have an idea of numbers for the venue, and how much Laura needs to cough up for the pizzas. Feedback, suggestions and ideas for future topics are welcome on our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/php-north-east).

Please promote this event via Twitter or your own website to help us spread the word. After the event, we will be heading to [The Ware Rooms](http://www.thewarerooms.co.uk/) for some informal discussions and some refreshing beverages.

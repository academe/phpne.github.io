We are pleased to announce the PHP North East talk for March 2015, “Neo4j: An introduction” by Chris Kemper.

Chris is a developer over at [Drummond Central](http://drummondcentral.co.uk) where he writes PHP and wears nerdy T-shirts.

# Neo4j: An introduction

Everything seems to be related to everything else these days, and your typical relational database may no longer be enough. Have you every wanted to be able to create product recommendations, recommend a friend, or even work out the shortest distance to a location? Neo4j could help you with that, and I'm here to make the introduction.

During this talk, I'll be going through the basics of Neo4j and its benefits for relational data. I'll also go through some example data structures, how to work out distances, creating recommendations, and more.

To help demonstrate Neo4j in action, I'll run through the creation of a small app, which uses it, going from nothing, to a working (hopefully, live) version. This will cover importing data, how to query that data, and a few other things too.

The event will take place at the Campus North, Sunco House, 5 Carliol Square, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE1 6UF (location map at bottom of [Ignite](http://ignite.io/) site). Thanks to [Campus North](http://campusnorth.co.uk/) for their sponsorship of a free venue and pre-event drinks.

As usual, special thanks to the generous sponsorship of Laura Sharpe of [Sharpe Recruitment](http://www.sharperecruitment.co.uk/), there will once again be a stack of pizzas for you to enjoy before the talk. If you are looking for your next challenge, or need to expand you team, look no further!

The event is free and open to all, but please sign up online so that we have an idea of numbers for the venue, and how much Laura needs to cough up for the pizzas. Feedback, suggestions and ideas for future topics are welcome on our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/php-north-east).

Please promote this event via Twitter or your own website to help us spread the word. After the event, we will be heading to [The Ware Rooms](http://www.thewarerooms.co.uk/) for some informal discussions and some refreshing beverages.

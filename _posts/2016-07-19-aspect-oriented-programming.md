## Aspect Oriented Programming - [Richie McFarlane][6]

If we’re following the Single Responsibility Principle and separating concerns then should the API class you’re writing also concern itself with logging?

Do you have fragile legacy code you’d rather not go hacking about in?

Need to profile to every method in a namespace to find a bottle neck?

Aspect Orientated Programming is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns.
It does so by adding additional behaviour to existing code without modifying the code itself.

This talk will focus on using the Go! AOP Framework with Magento, but the principles discussed could be applied to WordPress, Drupal, legacy code, or any project you’re working on.

## Richie McFarlane

Richie is a developer at Peacock Carter since February, and has been a developer for nine years.
Focused on Magento 1.x for the last three years, Richie’s also work with Laravel, Drupal, and WordPress.

After the event, many of us will be going to [The Ware Rooms][7] next door for some liquid refreshments.

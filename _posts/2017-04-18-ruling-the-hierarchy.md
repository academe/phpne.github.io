## Microservices vs The Distributed Monolith by Philip Brown

Hierarchical data is a common requirement in web applications. From ecommerce product taxonomies to folder structures, storing and querying that data in an efficient manner is tricker than it might seem.

This talk will walk you through the most common methods for storing and querying hierarchical data in a relational database. We will look at the positives and negatives of each method, when each might be appropriate, and we will take a deeper dive into one of the methods that enables Papertrail to store and quickly query hundreds of thousands of folders for thousands of customers.

[Philip][8] is a developer at [papertrail.io][9], a Software-as-a-Service product which helps companies comply with health and safety legislation. You can find his blog at [culttt.com][10].

After the event, many of us will be going to the [Ware Rooms][11] next door for some liquid refreshments.

After a brief hiatus, we are back with the September edition of PHP NE!
With pizzas provided by Laura Sharpe of [Sharpe Recruitment][1] and venue provided by Campus North.

The event will take place at **Campus North, Sunco House, 5 Carliol Square, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE1 6UF** (location map at bottom of [Ignite][2] site).

The event is free and open to all, but please sign up online so that we have an idea of numbers for the venue, and how much Laura needs to cough up for the pizzas.
Feedback, suggestions and ideas for future topics are welcome on our [Google Group][3].

## SQL for JSON by [Matthew Revell][4]
 
Query hasn’t always been a priority for NoSQL databases.
In the pursuit of scale, uptime and flexibility, non-relational databases largely threw out sophisticated query or introduced novel forms of query.
N1QL is a new SQL-like language created specifically for querying JSON data and it makes its first appearance in Couchbase Server 4.0.
In this talk we’ll look at N1QL and a bit more about Couchbase generally.

Matthew Revell is Director of Developer Advocacy for Couchbase and is also the organiser of DevRelCon, a conference about developer relations.
Like everyone else, he wrote a custom CMS in PHP many years ago, which suffered from many questionable design decisions.

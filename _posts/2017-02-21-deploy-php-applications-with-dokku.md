For our February meeting, we are pleased to announce **Deploying PHP applications with Dokku** by Steve Hobbs.
With pizzas provided by [Sharpe Recruitment][2], venue provided by [Campus North][3], and additional sponsorship from [Opia][4] and [Better Brand Agency][5].

The event will take place at **Campus North, Carliol Square, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE1 6UF** ([map][6]).

The event is **free** and open to all, but please sign up online so that we have an idea of numbers for the venue and catering.
Feedback, suggestions and ideas for future topics are welcome on [Twitter][7].

## Deploying PHP applications with Dokku by Steve Hobbs

[Dokku][8] is a docker based platform-as-a-service, which makes it easy to deploy your applications, link database containers and assign and enable LetsEncrypt SSL certificates.
Following this talk you will be able to deploy your next PHP projects with a simple `git push`.

Steve is a senior software developer at [Opencast Software][9].

After the event, many of us will be going to the [Ware Rooms][10] next door for some liquid refreshments.

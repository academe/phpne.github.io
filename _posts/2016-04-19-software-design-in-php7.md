For our April event we are pleased to announce **Software Design in PHP7** by **Paul Dragoonis**!
With pizzas provided by [Laura Sharpe][1] of [Sharpe Recruitment][2] and venue provided by Campus North.

The event will take place in **The Classroom, Campus North, Carliol Square, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE1 6UF** (location map at bottom of [Ignite][3] site).

The event is free and open to all, but please sign up online so that we have an idea of numbers for the venue, and how much Laura needs to cough up for the pizzas.

## Software Design in PHP7 by [Paul Dragoonis][5]

PHP and software development is moving quite fast these days, but which programming paradigms help you write better code?
Which OOD/OOP principles and architectural styles will help your software easier to understand, maintain and grow?

This talk focuses on some well known design patterns and how to practically implement, combine and leverage them in your PHP applications.
Paul will also teach you how to take things to the next level by taking advantage of new PHP7 features.

Paul, from Glasgow, works as a full-stack software consultant and QA engineer.
He contributes to PHP, PHP extensions, [php.net][6] website, PHP-FIG, many frameworks, and open source projects.
He’s a member of the PHP-FIG group and lead developer of PPI (“The PHP Framework Engine”) ([ppi.io][7]), where he focuses on framework interoperability and multi-framework co-operation.
Paul is passionate about software quality and architecture.
When not working on software Paul enjoys fishing, martial arts, and sleeping.

After the event, many of us will be going to [the Ware Rooms][8] next door, for some liquid refreshments.

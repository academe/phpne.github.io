We are pleased to announce the August event for PHP North East, **Design Pattern Lightning Talks**.

The event will take place at the Post Office in Pink Lane ([@PostOfficeNE1][1]) courtesy of PNE.  Thanks to the generous sponsorship of Laura Sharpe of [Sharpe Recruitment][2], there will once again be a stack of pizzas before the talk.

The event is free and open to all, but please sign up online so that we have an idea of numbers for the venue, and how much Laura needs to cough up for the pizzas.  Feedback, suggestions and ideas for future topics are welcome on our [Google Group][3].

Please promote this event via Twitter or your own website to help us spread the word.

Design Pattern Lightning Talks are 10 minute lightning talks from a range of presenters, including:

- Adapter / Decorator - [@AnthonySterling][4]
- Strategy - [@CraigTweedy][5]
- Registry - [@MichaelPeacock][6]
- Factory - [@MattKirwan][7]

Followed by Q&A at the venue time permitting, or down the pub afterwards.

Many of us will be enjoying a refreshing beverage or two after the talks at the Town Wall Pub in Pink Lane, it would be great if you could join us for that too.
